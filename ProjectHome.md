<b>Stableorbit</b> is a collection of programs used for generating and simulating solar systems. The most recent additions to the collection have been a client and a server (solarClient and solarServer). The client is 3D visualization used for evaluating and viewing systems downloaded from the server. The server provides clients with the ability to retrieve previously generated systems and save newly generated ones. Both work together as a distributed solar system generator and viewer.<br>
